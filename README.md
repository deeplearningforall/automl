# autonet
Ability to use deep neural networks to build and train neural networks and evolve their architectures to improve their prediction performace.
# Running the model
$python train_autonetv0.1.py

--> Runs all episodes (preset is 10)
--> dumps the training file to location autonet/autonetdata as a pickle file
Intention is to use this pickle file for training the RL model offline.
--> need to still write the code to train RL model separately
